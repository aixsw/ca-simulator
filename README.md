# Cambridge Analytica Simulator
This project will attempt to show how by scrambling psychometrics, a subject can avoid being clustered in groups. This exercise aims to support the argument that Cambridge Analytica works with psychometrics to classify individuals and then clusters them in order to show content and messages aimed at steering towards certain voting decisions. If a user scrambles their profiles and, for example, follow pages, persons or accounts they would not normally follow, CA's and FB's algorithms may have a hard time classifying this user, and hence will start receiving messages aimed at different clusters.

Motivation for this study is described in [our blog post about the subject](https://blog.datank.ai)
